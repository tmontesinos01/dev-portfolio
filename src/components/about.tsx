                            I'm Tomas, a Full-Stack Engineer with over 5 years of experience building scalable systems and real-world software solutions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I specialize in backend architecture with .NET and modern frontend development using React and Next.js. Most of my work has focused on designing administrative and healthcare management systems, where reliability, performance, and maintainability truly matter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Throughout my career, I've developed electronic invoicing platforms, real-time integrations, and IoT-based control systems — always aiming to build solutions that are not only functional, but scalable and resilient.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I care deeply about clean architecture, long-term code quality, and practical system design. For me, good software is not just about shipping features — it's about building systems that stand the test of time.
